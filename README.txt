This project was configured to work with a raspberry pi. I bought a "bruh" button off Amazon and cannibalized it so that the original audio chip didn't drive the speakers anymore and it got power from the pi. I also bought a cheap amplifier (PAM8302) off Adafruit to properly drive the speaker from a 3.5mm jack. The setup is pretty simple - provide 5V power and ground to the amp circuit using whatever pins you want, and hook up the button with a 1kohm resistor in series from a 3.3v pin to a gpio pin of your choice (I picked pin 10). Finally I used a 3.5mm jack to screw terminal (2914) from Adafruit to connect ground and the left audio channel to the audio input for the amp circuit. The speaker is simply connected to the output of the amp. Since the audio I was using was mono anyway it turned out fine.
